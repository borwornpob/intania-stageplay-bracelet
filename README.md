The bracelet is constructed using the following components:

-   ESP-32 Development Board: The core of our bracelet, responsible for wireless communication and LED control.

-   LiPo Battery (7.2v): Provides power to the bracelet ensuring seamless performance.

-   Step-down Converter: Converts the 7.2v from the battery down to a safer 5v for our electronics.
